You can more conveniently compile and run a C++ program in this folder (ie c)
by executing the following command (assuming you have cd'd to this folder):

bash compile-run-cpp.sh <file_name>.cpp

If the program consists of multiple files, you can list them all in the command above.

Please use the TAB key to complete the program name and the file name when typing the above.
